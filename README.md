# food-waste-app
Recipe generator and food waste eliminator made through AI 

The purpose of this app is to reduce food waste and allow people to come up with recipes with the food they already have, as well as generate grocery lists minimizing the food they need to purchase to create recopies with food already existing. This app should be able to take a photo of a grocery receipt or manually insert information and create a list of the food that the user already has. The app should then work with the user and a llm to generate potential recopies prioritizing using food that the user already has. The user can then select a recipe and the app will generate a grocery list of the additional items that you need to get. When a user makes a recipe, the app should adjust its internal list automatically, and the user should be able to manually update as well. Help me generate code for this app.

As a coder, I'm practicing working with LLMs to generated and refine code more efficiently while also using LLM APIs (Gemini Flash 2.5) to expand functionality and practice product management more than development itself.

The goal of this project is to develop an interface that is genuinely useful for me regarding maintaining my kitchen moving forward as I want to improve efficiency in my personal life.
